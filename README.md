## Installing and Running

Download the latest version of Node. This program is written with version 10.15.1, but should work for any LTS version of Node.

If you are behind a proxy server, you will first need to tell `npm` about it. If you are not behind a proxy server, you may jump to the next step.

```
> npm config set your_proxy
```

Install supporting libraries.

```
> npm install
```

Run the application. This will convert the TypeScript to JavaScript and run the program locally.

```
> npm run start
```

Create a build. This will drop the necessary files in the `dist` folder.

```
> npm run build
```
